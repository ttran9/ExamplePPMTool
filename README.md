# Personal Management Tool
- I'm creating this repository to follow along with [this course](https://www.udemy.com/full-stack-project-spring-boot-20-react-redux)
using React and Spring Boot. 


# Directory Structure
- The directory "ppmtool" will house the back-end code (i.e the API and Java based code).


# Video notes
- For each lecture I may be updating the video_notes.md file which is a separate file for where I make down contents that I was
unsure of or that I am just needing to reference.

# Progress
- At this point/commit the master branch has changes up to the end of section 2.
