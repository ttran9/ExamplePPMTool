Video 52:

- For setting up MySQL I decided to create MySQL inside of docker and I decided to use a slightly different set up than
from the video.
    - I will be using application-dev for credentials to the database inside my docker image and once we upload to Heroku
    I will be using the application-prod.yml file.
        - I will be modifying my application-prod.yml file in section 8 when we deploy this prototype to Heroku.
