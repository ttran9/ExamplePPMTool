- The instructor calls his user "User" and I am calling it "ApplicationUser".
    - I'm not sure if this is necessary but I remember when using the name User I ran into an issue with a PostgreSQL
    database a while back although I know in this course we are using MySQL and when uploading to Heroku we are using
    a plugin, Clear DB.
