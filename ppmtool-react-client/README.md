## Information

- This is the front-end of a web application in which I use webpack to compress the React content into a compressed JavaScript file which is referenced by the backend application's index.html in order to display the views.
- The repository for the back-end can be seen [here](https://github.com/ttran9/ppmtool-backend).

## Live Demo:
